            monthly coordination meetings in Kabul and at provincial offices; meetings such as the Afghanistan
            Development Forum (ADF) and ACBAR Afghanistan Humanitarian Forum (ACBAR AHF) that elevate
            discussion with the Ministries and UN on policy and practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            ACBAR also provides open access to hundreds of reports, donor strategies, field researches, laws
            and policies on Afghanistan through its website and directly to its members in order to improve
            knowledge and practice.

          <h4 class="color-green">Advocacy & Enabling Environment</h4>

          <p>
            ACBAR plays a leading role in defending the interests of NGOs with the Government, international
            community and other relevant stakeholders. ACBAR has regular advocacy meetings to facilitate
            policy discussions and identify joint advocacy issues. ACBAR actively promotes the role and
            principles of NGOs to improve access and aid delivery to beneficiaries and strongly advocates for
            the protection of aid workers and civilians. This has led to the publication of multiple reports
            and position papers on aid effectiveness, the militarization of aid and the rights of marginalized
            groups such as IDPs, returnees, people with disabilities, women and the poor. ACBAR maintains
            close links with key players and decision makers by taking part in the Humanitarian Country Team
            (HCT), Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund (AHF) Advisory Board and relevant international conferences
            to represent the NGO community in Afghanistan.

          <p>
            In all the main provincial cities in Afghanistan, ACBARâ€™s training team provides workshops and
            trainings on e.g. Afghan laws, humanitarian principles and project cycle management to NGO
            partners and the wider civil society.
          </p>
          <p>
            The objective is to enhance skills of the national staff in organizational management, to explain
            international principles including standards and to illustrate best practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            ACBARâ€™s Twinning programme builds the capacity of National NGOs by preparing them for entry into
            the UNOCHAâ€™s humanitarian pooled funds and by pairing them with International NGOs to provide
            mentoring and guidance to their Afghan counterparts on institutional management and humanitarian
            practice.
          </p>
